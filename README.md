- rule-based strategies
- backtesting
- statistical analysis
- risk awareness

## Strategy Logic
- Market: EUR/USD
- Timeframe: M5
- Session: London
- Entry:
  - Buy when price breaks the Asian session high
  - Sell when price breaks the Asian session low
- Risk Management:
  - Fixed stop-loss
  - Fixed take-profit
- Max one trade per day

## Why This Project
This strategy is intentionally simple.
It serves as a learning project to understand:
- whether session breakouts have statistical edge
- how volatility impacts results
- limitations of naive breakout strategies
